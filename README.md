Generating Receipt for customer.
Create Purchasing Information and Receipts for Lovely Loveseats.

We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for our customers.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables.Then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them.

Cheers !!
